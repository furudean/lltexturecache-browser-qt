"""Which texture a picture is of

A cache is searched by handing it a picture — a screenshot of a texture in
world, or a copy of the texture off disk — and asking which of its entries
look like it. All an entry has to answer with is the thumbnail the viewer kept
beside it, which is sixteen pixels square at the most, so both sides are
squashed down to the coarse grid they can meet on and compared there, in the
same lab the colour filters work in.

What a picture of a texture keeps of the texture is where its light and dark
patches lie, and what it loses is everything else: a screenshot is lit by
whatever was around it, taken at whatever size the camera was, and cropped by
hand. So the comparison is made against the layout alone, with each side's own
brightness and contrast divided out of it first, and how light or how coloured
the two are overall left to settle the ties.
