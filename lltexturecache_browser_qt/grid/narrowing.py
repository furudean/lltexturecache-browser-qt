"""Which textures the grid is showing, and in what order

A cache is filtered by colour or ranked against a picture, and either way the
textures holding no picture at all can be left out of it. All three answers
come out of the scan, which arrives long after the grid has been filled, so
what is being asked for is kept here and applied whenever there is something
to apply it against.
